"32936760#1397861#8","Good cake BUT: it was not the best cake i've ever had, and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked employees."

"35709141#1107179#3","We requested they re-slice the sushi, and it was returned to us in small cheese-like cubes."
"11351354#412616#1","The service, however, is a peg or two below the quality of food (horrible bartenders), and the clientele, for the most part, are rowdy, loud-mouthed commuters (this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff) getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game."
"11349840#433070#8","If you're in the neighborhood, definitely stop by for a great meal."

"11660930#655010#4","Stick to the items the place does best, brisket, ribs, wings, cajun shrimp is good, not great."
"35509422#0#0","Hip boutiques and bars on Ludlow add to the artsy, laid-back atmosphere at this Israeli-style takeout and eat-in burger joint."
"35509422#0#1","Young neighborhood trendies graze at the counter during the day, while chic, art-house drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night."

"11359613#884374#0","The food is consistant and good but how it got name Best Diner In Manhattan is beyond me."
"11349840#433070#6","The pasta primavera was outstanding as well, lots of fresh veggies."
"32894267#698671#4","don't get me wrong - sushi was good, just not fantastic."
"35693083#822138#1","Being Puerto Rican I know a thing or two about flan and this place serves one of the best (I hope Mom doesn't read this!)."

"11351587#1488758#1","The ambiance was fine, a little loud but still nice and romantic."

"11359764#1373169#1","Who said go when the place is quiet during the day?"
"35698351#821341#1","Can be a bit busy around peak times because of the size."
"11351360#1704700#0","I was on jury duty, rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome chicken tacos and Hibiscus lemonade."
"32894791#1611374#1","good place to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic french dish over a glass of wine."
"36072604#1106889#4","Very nice touch that very much fits the place."
"11350033#1264371#2","However, there is just something so great about being outdoors, in great landscaping, enjoying a casual drink that makes going to this place worthwhile."
"11567247#1415594#1","We were seated promptly in close proximity to the dance floor."
"11351521#768768#2","If you are here as a pre-show meal, hop in a cab and take the extra 10 minutes to go to the uptown location."
"11350033#1264371#5","A plus was the good mix of people in their twenties that provided for great eye-candy while I was there."
"11651065#413029#1","The comments about fried foods is correct (below) but the other dishes, including the lamb entree and many of the salads (avocado shrimp) were quite good."

"11349845#1188496#2","Don't ever bother - the drinks were awful, but it was the people who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining."
"33070305#1312437#5","The room is a little plain, but it's difficult to make such a small place exciting and I would not suggest that as a reason not to go."
"11432842#416795#4","Prices even outside of restaurant week were great."
"35509422#0#2","A small, outdoor eating area makes for a private, comfortable space to study alone or meet up with friends."
"32408649#945413#0","Before the place didn't call my attention."
"35670845#1650649#3","And all the [female] servers are cute too, which is always nice."
"35170181#0#5","The best dessert, a chocolate and peanut butter tart, isn't particularly Hawaiian, but it's a small world when it comes to sweets."
"11359619#487952#7","for an appetizer, their calamari is a winner."
"32464595#574909#1","Satay is one of those favorite haunts on Washington where the service and food is always on the money."

"11351587#1488758#3","It is bland and nothing extrodinary."
"32950061#1264345#3","I was especially impressed during the bday party when the waitstaff went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly service to a 15 person party."

"11464511#471981#1","We were seated next to a couple whose kitchen was being renovated and we agreed since we're all foodies who eat out a lot - that this wasn't a place we'd return to."
"32899282#556036#1","They are served on Focacchia bread and are to die for."
"32894966#1727613#3","While the smoothies are a little big for me, the fresh juices are the best I have ever had!"
"32464601#418474#0","The food is just OKAY, and it's almost not worth going unless you're getting the pialla, which is the only dish that's really good."
"11432442#650772#2","The guac is fresh, yet lacking flavor, we like to add our fresh salsa into it."
"11313290#1139539#1","The new menu has a few creative items,they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites (but they raised the prices), the staff is friendly most of the time, but I must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words: No, can't, sorry..., boy, they won't bend the rules for anyone."
"33061445#591371#0","It' only open for lunch but the food is so good!"
