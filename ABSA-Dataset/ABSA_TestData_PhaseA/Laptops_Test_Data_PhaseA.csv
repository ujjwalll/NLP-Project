"787:444","The criticism has waned, and now I'd be the first to recommend an Air for truly portable computing."
"1141:1","I would have given it 5 starts was it not for the fact that it had Windows 8"
"787:495","MS Office 2011 for Mac is wonderful, well worth it."

"46:1","Very powerful especially for the money."
"563:1","When my Dell laptop gave up only after 2 1/2 years, I decided to buy MacBook Pro."
"417:1","It's been time for a new laptop, and the only debate was which size of the Mac laptops, and whether to spring for the retina display."

"375:0","I have always wanted a MacBook Pro.....always!"
"727:1","The reason why I choose apple MacBook because of their design and the aluminum casing."

"37:1","It is very easy to integrate bluetooth devices, and USB devices are recognized almost instantly."
"741:1","He's thrilled with his new laptop."
"532:1","Amazing product as you would expect from Apple."
"757:1","Nothing wrong with this computer at all!"
"891:8","And the fact that Apple is driving the 13"" RMBP with the Intel4000 graphic chip seems underpowered (to me."
"786:42","I have to wonder why Amazon is even selling this dinosaur."
"19:1","Apple removed the DVD drive Firewire port (will work with adapter) and put the SDXC slot in a silly position on the back."
"907:1","No hassle and no complaints."
"786:1","LOVE IT I've always been an apple fan boy, but never had the money to buy a mac, only ipads and iphones, and this is my first mac, blew me away completely."

"422:1","Well designed and fast."

"1119:1","Exactly as posted plus a great value."
"29:81","The specs are pretty good too."
"1045:1","I am having a friend look at it , but will probably return it."
"682:1","There were no scratches or dents or any marks at all."
"148:1","I've only had it one day, but I really do love it and I'm happy it was economical and I'm finally able to own a Mac!"
"652:1","Since I have always used Apple products, the choice of Macbook Pro was obvious."
"211:1","Apple is unmatched in product quality,aesthetics,craftmanship, and customer service."
"888:1","This is my first apple laptop."
"1078:1","It makes a great gift."
"1159:1","It is a great size and amazing windows 8 included!"
"661:1","I would recommend to any one lloking for a first class computer!"
"1150:1","I do not like too much Windows 8."
"787:272","Startup times are incredibly long: over two minutes."
"369:0","I bought this Macbook Pro from Best Buy under a year ago to replace my old Macbook Air."

"333:1","This computer does everything i need it to do for school and more."
"786:1423","It is really thick around the battery."
"974:1","And windows 7 works like a charm."
"151:1","And I can attach my projector to it."
"605:1",":) Great product, great price, great delivery, and great service."
"846:1",":] It arrived so fast and customer service was great."
"983:1","tried windows 8 and hated it !!!"
"912:1","The price is higher than most lab top out there; however, he/she will get what they paid for, which is a great computer."
"449:1","So, I thought why not give Mac Book pro a try."
"723:1","Set up was a breeze."
"1122:1","But I do NOT like Win8."
"893:1","I have owned at least 4 to 5 laptops and computers - but this is by far the most superior machine I have ever owned."
"856:1","I am still in the process of learning about its features."
"786:214","BTW, I checked online regarding the old laptop that 'died' and found that I was not alone, far from it."
"609:1","I had the same reasons as most PC users: the price, the overbearing restrictions of OSX and lack of support for games."
"101:1","I wanted it for it's mobility and man, this little bad boy is very nice."
"7:23","Seems to me that's the best way to get Apple's attention."
"1126:1","Very nice so far."
"668:1","You won't be disappointed."
"799:1","The investment of a new MacBook Pro came at a price, but totally worth it for a good piece of mind."
"156:1","I found the mini to be:Exceptionally easy to set up"
"29:318","Having USB3 is why I bought this Mini."
"787:622","Be sure to have good air flow where ever you put it."
"480:7","The sound is nice and loud; I don't have any problems with hearing anything."
"720:1","It is very slim, the track pad is very much impressed with me."
"787:717","This was the same problem with my MacBook (circa 2007) that I just retired."
"229:1","Great things come in small ""packages."
"934:0","HUGE Apple MAC Fan!"
"387:1","Looked at HP, ASUS, Acer, Sony and a bunch of other ones but could not find I really liked."
"1122:5","The settings are not user-friendly either."
"7:22","Honestly, I am surprised no one else has mentioned returning theirs."
"439:1","Most of them were either too big, too noisy and too slow after 2 years."
"386:1","The machine is used, but is like new, i'm very impress."
"1063:180","Thank goodness for OpenOffice!"
"627:1","Awesome form factor, great battery life, wonderful UX."
"302:1","Needless to say, the leap from that to this has been amazing and (aside from the financial reasons) I am astounded that I hadn't made the switch sooner."
"792:1","Its perfect, not much heavy."
"876:1","i love the keyboard and the screen."
"1113:1","I find it not to be very user friendly."
"536:1","It has surpassed all expectations and fulfilled all my needs."
"998:1","However, there are MAJOR issues with the touchpad which render the device nearly useless."
"292:1","What angers me more than anything else is that I spent all those years hating MACs when I could have been getting a lot more production with a whole lot less grief!"
"104:1","I've already upgraded o Mavericks and I am impressed with everything about this computer."
"787:711","So this is very good commputer and i highly suggest it."
"517:1","the mbp i recieved was everything it should have been."
"1049:1","I was going to buy today and noticed it went back up to $344.99?"
"218:1","Not as fast as I would have expect for an i5."
"622:1","SO of course this one came through with the awesomeness!"
"787:648","You will not regret buying this computer!"
"826:1","Nothing bad to say about it."
"850:1","It s heavy for Mac book but is good."
"79:1","thanks for great service and shipping!"
"787:725","Deal of the year."
"842:7","My sisters same laptop broke about the month later for the same reason."
"29:367","Minis make sense for a lot of people."
"16:1","The performance seems quite good, and built-in applications like iPhoto work great with my phone and camera."
"29:358","This Mac Mini makes the Macbook Pro seem slow."
"895:1","I did swap out the hard drive for a Samsung 830 SSD which I highly recommend."
"836:1","I bought this MacBook Pro to replace my six-year-old PC (a Sony Vaio), but it was basically no better than my old PC, so I returned it."
"1087:1","I wanted a simple, reliable  laptop."
"846:2","Cheaper than buying it @ apple too!"
"1063:165","I have just had to learn to be a little harder typer than on my last computer."
"335:1","Extremely disappointed with the way it is."
"342:1","Never been happier using  computer."
"442:1","I have had a total of 5 different laptop from many different manufactures."
"534:1","Does everything I wanted this laptop to do."
"905:2","Besides, the apple stocks have been falling due to lack of sales."
"1071:1","Turns out this is a common problem."
"714:1","Starts up in a hurry and everything is ready to go."
"904:1","It is also fast as can be... you get what you pay for... well worth the investment"
"252:1","But I'm still learning so can't rate it yet for everything."
"787:497","Overall very impressed, Thank you Apple and Amazon!"
"786:876","Yes, that's a good thing, but it's made from aluminum that scratches easily."
"1091:1","Very fast for my needs."
"385:1","I bought this Mac in order to replace my old Dell laptop."
"566:1","Quick and has built in virus control."
"491:1","Took a long time trying to decide between one with retina display and one without."
"107:1","I saw the Mini Mac at Best Buy and decided to get this as my replacement."
"690:1","I finally decided on this one and couldn't be any happier."
"278:5","I was also informed that the components of the Mac Book were dirty."
"732:1","So glad I did not waste money on a less than par product."
"787:682","Haven't regretted it one bit."
"155:1","The one thing that Apple does right is computers."
"337:1","the hardware problems have been so bad, i can't wait till it completely dies in 3 years, TOPS!"
"857:1","It's so nice that the battery last so long and that this machine has the snow lion!"
"777:1","I think that they are the best out on the market."
"927:1","HOWEVER I chose two day shipping and it took over a week to arrive."
"29:428","That's quite a bump up from the $599 that this little guy sells for, which leaves me to my next point."
"419:1","this is quite smooth as well as heavy and can easily slip through the hands."
"787:429","My laptop is so light that I can take it with me anywhere."
"679:1","it's exactly what i wanted, and it has all the new features and whatnot."
"476:1","You can do absolutely anything and is very fast and stylish."
"585:1","Finally decided to try a MAC because there were too many choices of which PC's to buy and EVERYONE who had a MAC said ""buy a MAC""."
"503:1","Can you buy any laptop that matches the quality of a MacBook?"
"1040:1","It feels cheap, the keyboard is not very sensitive."
"842:9","That defeated the whole point of a laptop."
"982:1","Though please note that sometimes it crashes, and the sound quality isnt superb."
"748:1","It is very easy to navigate even for a novice."
"170:1","But until now, no complains at all."
"1063:159","The cons are more annoyances that can be lived with."
"989:1","Does everything I need it to, has a wonderful battery life and I couldn't be happier."
"765:1","Great Performance and Quality."
"1030:4","Just What I Needed For Portable And My Wallet Too!"
"502:1","The device speaks about it self."
"462:1","I used windows XP, windows Vista, and Windows 7 extensively."
"914:1","the only thing that bums me out about this purchase is they released a newer updated mbp seriously RIGHT after i bought this one."
"890:1","it does get hot when using on a bed or sofa and gets warm on a desk....this is in an un-air conditioned room.....in air condition it gets slightly warm......"
"124:1","I did add a SSD drive and memory"
"790:0","I got this one for thanks giving Offer for $962 :)."
"896:1","I had my PC laptop for 3 years and going to a MacBook Pro is like I leaped through time."
"269:1","On start up it asks endless questions just so itune can sell you more of their products."
"29:369","Pretty much made sense to get a Mini."
"332:1","I Have been a Pc user for a very long time now but I will get used to this new OS."
"869:1","not something you want to miss out on!!!"
"787:628","One more thing, this mac does NOT come with restore disks and I am not sure if you can make them direct from the mac like you can with newer PC's, also the charging cables are made of the same cheap material as the iPhone/iPod touch cables."
"300:1","I bought it to my son who uses it for graphic design."
"320:1","I previously owned an older Dell laptop that died after about 5 or 6 years."
"964:1","Its a pretty decent computer."
"29:312","I never tried any external mics with that iMac."
"580:1","The new os is great on my macbook pro!"
"478:1","It was fast, and it was ""different""."
"1027:1","I had a little problem adjusting to the small screen but works fine as long as I remember to carry my glasses."
"647:1","I purchased my first Mac and am glad I did."
"705:1","I have experienced no problems, works as anticipated."
"873:1","System is running great."
"633:1","Easy to customize setting and even create your own bookmarks."
"276:1","They really screwed the pooch on this one."
"105:1","The MAC Mini, wireless keyboard / mouse and a HDMI cable is all I need to get some real work done."
"89:1","I finally pulled the trigger and I am blown away by how much more I enjoy my computer tasks using the Mac Mini!!!"
"1076:1","it has all the features that we expected and the price was good, working well so far."
"112:1","I work as a designer and coder and I needed a new buddy to work with, not gaming."
"832:17","I was told that it seems to be a multi - component failure."
"453:1","The new operating system makes this computer into a super iPad."
"733:1","I am very happy with my first Mac."
"179:1","Easy to set up and go!"
"900:1","I can't believe how quiet the hard drive is and how quick this thing boots up."
"1:26","The only issue came when I tried scanning to the mac."
"874:1","The machine is speedy and efficient."
"993:1","I think this is about as good as it gets at anything close to this price point."
"122:1","A *big* upgrade from my 13"" 2006 macbook."
"945:1","It's just what we were looking for and it works great."
"542:1","Having a Mac certainly makes life easier."
"709:1","It's so quick and responsive that it makes working/surfing on a computer so much more pleasurable!"
"771:1","The old unibody macbook pro could fry an egg after a while."
"87:1","It works fine, and all the software seems to run pretty well."
"984:1","For this purpose, it's great."
"600:1","Couldn't have asked for more!"
"0:1","I'm using this computer for word processing, web browsing, some gaming, and I'm learning programming."
"91:1","It certainly does, but you rarely hear any of your friends with Mac's complain about anything."
"477:1","My wife was so excited to open the box, but quickly came to see that it did not function as it should."
"786:537","I don't have any technical pearls to share."
"383:1","I wanted a computer that was quite, fast, and that had overall great performance."
"160:19","Apple ""Help"" is a mixed bag."
"358:1","All I can say is I am impressed."
"268:1","It suddenly can not work."
"508:1","It did everything we expected!"
"279:0","Harddrive was in poor condition, had to replace it."
"200:1","The on/off switch is a bit obscure in the rear corner."
"29:1053","It's a nice little gadget."
"28:1","My only complaint is the total lack of instructions that come with the mac mini."
"2:1","The only task that this computer would not be good enough for would be gaming, otherwise the integrated Intel 4000 graphics work well for other tasks."
"919:1","It's macbook pro and there is no discusion about it."
"231:1","I'm hoping the rest of the features will be the signature quality of apple."
"923:1","I use it mostly for content creation (Audio, video, photo editing) and its reliable."
"59:1","It is the best all around Mac."
"462:8","Screen is bright and gorgeous."
"102:1","Also is portable and reliable."
"382:15","The only solution is to turn the brightness down, etc."
"787:137","It is not an easy decision to purchase a used or even good as new laptop but I am very satisfied."
"227","If you want more information on macs I suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications."
"670:1","It is robust, with a friendly use as all Apple products."
"920:1","Even if you don't do business, thats okay, it's incredibly fast."
"880:1","It is fast and easy to use."
"1063:184","This was absolutely annoying!"
"745:1","And the fact that it comes with an i5 processor definitely speeds things up"
"261:2","But for those of you that dont have a mac and are still on the PC's this is a good foot in the door into mac."
"889:1","I have been PC for years but this computer is intuitive and its built in features are a great help"
"980:1","and it fits in my briefcase with ease"
"1094:1","Nice screen, keyboard works great!"
"1067:5","Still not bad for 220.00."
"575:1","I was amazed at how fast the delivery was."
"373:0","Good computer and fast."
"165:1","I've installed to it additional SSD and 16Gb RAM."
"972:1","The memory was gone and it was not able to be used."
"505:1","Its pretty much fire it up and go."
"796:1","It works great and I am so happy I bought it."
"275:1","Let me start off by saying that I was highly reluctant to spend so much money on a laptop."
"1138:1","I like the design and ease of use with the keyboard, plenty of ports."

"440:1","I am used to computers with windows so I am having a little difficulty finding my way around."
"786:173","They replaced it and so far so good."
"626:1","It just works out of the box and you have a lot of cool software included with the OS."
"574:0","Good in every aspect."
"525:1","its as advertised on here..... it works great and is not a waste of money!"
"644:1","Replaced this one with my mac that was stolen, its a great computer."
"757:3","Just be careful; you always have to give up some good stuff for others."
"786:82","Runs like a champ....."
"786:155","Really great...Well let me start at the beginning."
"692:1","Premium price for the OS more than anything else."
"575:0","This was a gift for my grand son."
"976:1","I was a little concerned about the touch pad based on reviews, but I've found it fine to work with."
"762:1","I bought this Mac book pro along with a new 27"" iMac and while they are still light years more reliable than a PC I have noticed a decline in the reliability of my Mac computers."
"786:1301","The sound as mentioned earlier isn't the best, but it can be solved with headphones."
"786:1054","The track pad is a bit squirrely at times- sometimes too sensitive, and sometimes a bit unresponsive, but it's usable."
"479:6","However, the experience was great since the OS does not become unstable and the application will simply shutdown and reopen."
"478:3","Then only FOUR months later, my great MacBook pro FAILED."
"258:1","If you ask me, for this price it should be included."
"1044:1","The battery is not as shown in the product photos."
"416:1","Even though I could have gotten a pc twice the speed for the same price I still think there's nothing like a Mac."

"109:1","The Mac Mini is probably the simplest example of compact computing out there."
"96:1","Instead, I'll focus more on the actual performance and feature set of the hardware itself so you can make an educated decision on which Mac to buy."
"448:11","My bag just got a little lighter."
"450:0","I'm Not exagerating when I say this computer is perfect..i It is!!"
"316:3","This machine is flawless, fast, and classy."
"786:572","Other ports include FireWire 800, Gigabit Ethernet, MagSafe port, Microphone jack."
"388:2","I stayed up half the night enjoying my new MacBook Pro."
"786:773","This laptop is a 100 times better than a Chromebook!"
"325:1","Additionally, there is barely a ventilation system in the computer, and even the simple activity of watching videos let alone playing steam games causes the laptop to get very very hot, and in fact impossible to keep on lap."
"786:594","At $1899 to start, this is no cheap machine."
"965:1","Chatting with Acer support, I was advised the problem was corrupted operating system files."

"786:636","I might have read it incorrectly, but better safe than sorry right?"
"389:0","The ultimate graduation gift."
"347:1","The RAM memory is good but should have splurged for 8Mb instead of 4Mb."
"786:417","was debating to buy one for months, checked out different stuff on youtube, and read different articles and debates,I just didnt really wanna spend the money but Im glad that I did."
"316:4","I love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention PC's require."
"500:1","I was a little worry at first because I don't have a lot of experience with os.x and windows has always been second nature to me after many years of using windows."
"301:5","I am an Info Sys major in college, so I started researching this issue on my own."
"303:5","Solution: it turned out to be pretty simple."
"574:1","With the softwares supporting the use of other OS makes it much better."
"303:13","Still haven't solved this."

"301:7","I told them that I just received my brand new MacBook but I was having issues."

"891:1","At home and the office it gets plugged into an external 24"" LCD screen, so built in screen size is not terribly important."
"301:10","Hopefully my replacement is brand new."
"65:1","Just beware no DVD slot so when I went to install software I had on CD I couldn't."
"994:1","I bought it to be able to dedicate a small, portable laptop to my writing and was surprised to learn that I needed to buy a word processing program to do so."
"443:1","This version of MacBook Pro runs on a third-generation CPU (""Ivy Bridge""), not the latest fourth-generation Haswell CPU the 2013 version has."
"316:1","Actually, I think I was intimidated by the change from a PC."
"245:1","No Cd Rom in the new version there's no way I'm spending that kind of money on something has less features than the older version."

"270:1","I have three words: Piece of Junk!"
"1063:403","the volume is really low to low for a laptopwas not expectin t volume to be so lowan i hate that about this computer"
"786:1388","Fits all my personal needs."
"29:99","I'm the pro-active type so I went off and did some preventative fixes."

"786:379","I saw the bad reviews from people saying to buy directly from Apple and I was concerned but I took my chances and am overly impressed."
"11:1","The case is now slightly larger than the previous generation, but the lack of an external power supply justifies the small increase in size."
"1009:1","I had to buy a wireless mouse to go with it, as I am old school and hate the pad, but knew that before I bought it, now it works great, need to get adjusted to the key board, as I am used to a bigger one and pounding."
"404:1","When considering a Mac, look at the total cost of ownership and not just the initial price tag."
"1020:1","Has all the other features I wanted including a VGA port, HDMI, ethernet and 3 USB ports."
"540:3","A great college tool!"
"271:28","The only thing I dislike about this laptop are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the computer for grip."
"264:5","I called apple and no solution."
"1143:1","It's a decent computer for the price and hopefully it will last a long time."

"859:1","A lot of features and shortcuts on the MBP that I was never exposed to on a normal PC."
"768:1","Wasn't sure if I was going to like it much less love it so I went to a local best buy and played around with the IOS system on a Mac Pro and it was totally unique and different."

"1063:161","If you start on the far right side and scroll to your left the start menu will automatically come up."
"736:1","Best money I ever spent."
"67:1","My only gripe would be the need to add more RAM."
